      <h3>A third of all food produced is wasted.</h3>
        <hr />
      <p>Australian’s throw out $8 billion worth of edible food every single year.
        <em>That’s four million tonnes</em>.
        <br><br>
         In the last year, 5 million Australians had to skip or slim their meals,
          with 30% of them going without food for an entire day once a week.
          This includes not only our nation’s homeless but a large proportion of women,
        children and elderly - some of the most vulnerable members of our community.</p>

  <h5>Food For Free is a simple yet powerful solution: </h5>
  <p>Over-catered events and unexpected cancelations no longer need to result in huge food
    wastage. This food can now be seamlessly donated to a charity, going straight to the
    people and families who are unable to afford it.
    <br>
    We're bridging the gap between businesses who want to give back to their community
    and those charities and non-profit organisations running programs for those in need.</p>
